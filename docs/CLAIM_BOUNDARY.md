# Research Scope And Claim Boundary

## What this study proves
- Numerical behavior of direct and iterative linear solvers in a matrix-based image decryption workflow.
- Sensitivity of reconstruction quality and runtime under noise, sparsity, conditioning, and solver settings.

## What this study does NOT prove
- Modern cryptographic security for production systems.
- Resistance against adversarial cryptanalysis compared with AEAD standards.

## Language to use in paper
Use: "numerical robustness", "solver stability", "reconstruction quality", "algorithmic conditioning".
Avoid: "secure encryption for deployment", "cryptographically strong", "production-safe cipher".

## Recommended positioning sentence
"This work is a numerical analysis study of matrix-based decryption workflows, not a security proof of modern cryptographic primitives."
